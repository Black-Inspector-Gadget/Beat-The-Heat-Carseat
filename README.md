### About:
The present invention is designed towards a system that prevents caretakers from leaving loved ones in vehicles, which can possibly be unsafe due to the environment (extreme hot or cold temperatures) of an unattended vehicle. Specifically, the invention relates to a device that can be attached to a childâ€™s car seat which can provide an emergency notification to the users when a child/loved one is left buckled inside a vehicle, and outside the range of the caretaker.
